 

 This code was originally written for my BSc back around 2011 and was 
 effectively the first C++ code I wrote.
 
 The original project was created in Visual Studio under Windows...
 I retrieved the original code from my thesis and compiled it under Linux,
 which works. The code can be compiled (provided MPIR is present) and runs.
 
 At the time, the code was coded with limitations - for example a maximum
 number due to the need to maintain an array of prime numbers.
 
 Depending on time and interest, I may revive the code to try and improve 
 what may be called "the sins of the past" to produce a better organised 
 and more modern code. Though this comes of course with no guarantees.
